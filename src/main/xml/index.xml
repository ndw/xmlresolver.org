<title>Welcome to XMLResolver.org</title>
</info>

<note><para>These pages are a work in progress: they attempt to
document the XML Resolver 3.x release.
</para>
</note>

<para>As you can tell from the clever name, this site is about an XML
Resolver.
(The code is <link xlink:href="https://github.com/xmlresolver/xmlresolver/">over on
github</link>.) Many (Java-based) XML APIs include features for
"resolvers" of various sorts. For example, many XML parsers allow you
to define a "entity resolver" that can intercept attempts to load
system identifiers. Schema processors provide a "URI resolver" that
lets you intercept schema module URIs. Stylesheet and query processors
have similar APIs for intercepting stylesheet and query
modules.</para>

<para>The resolver APIs exist because it’s sometimes useful in applications
to return a locally cached resource instead of the resource actually
requested. It’s a significant feature of the web that you can
dereference the URI</para>

<programlisting>http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd</programlisting>

<para>and find out that it’s the DTD for XHTML. It is not, however,
<emphasis>desireable</emphasis> that <emphasis>everyone</emphasis>
should <emphasis>always</emphasis> dereference that URI to get the
XHTML DTD. It hasn’t changed in more than a decade and there’s no
reason to believe it will <emphasis>ever change again</emphasis>.</para>

<para>I know, DTDs are unfashionable and XHTML has measles or some
other disease against which the world should have been vaccinated, but
I chose that example with care. The W3C web server gets <emphasis>so
many</emphasis> requests for the XHTML DTD that it goes out of its way
to make retrieving it painful.</para>

<para>Go ahead, download that DTD. You’ll find that the server introduces a
significant delay before returning the data and if you get it
often enough they’ll lock you out for 24 hours or something.</para>

<para>Point being: there are lots of URIs which you can usefully cache
locally.</para>

<para>There are basically two approaches to local caching: you can
setup a proxy server and have it cache things for you, or you can use
<link xlink:href="https://xmlcatalogs.org">XML Catalogs</link>. Oh, I
don’t dispute there might be other approaches, but those are the two
common, obvious ones.</para>

<para>The advantage of the local caching proxy is that it’s automatic. It
caches the resources you request according to whatever criteria you
establish, it works transparently in the background. No muss, no fuss.
Well, except for the fact that you have to install and setup a local
caching proxy. You have to use it everywhere. You might have to chain
it together with your corporate caching proxy. You also have to
configure the criteria for local caching. I find its advantages are a
lot more theoretical than practical.</para>

<para>The XML Resolver project is about doing it with catalogs, but it
will also cache resources for you!</para>

<section xml:id="catalogs">
<title>XML Catalogs</title>

<para>Catalogs are straightforward, you provide an XML document that has
mappings from identifiers that might appear in documents to local
resources that should be returned for those identifiers.</para>

<para>Here’s an example:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[<catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog">
  <system systemId="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"
          uri="/share/dtds/xhtml1-strict.dtd"/>
</catalog>]]></programlisting>

<para>If you load that catalog, attempts to obtain the XHTML DTD from the W3C
will be satisfied by a local copy of the DTD obtained from the
<code>/share/dtds/xhtml1-strict.dtd</code>.</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="getting">
<title>How to get the XML Resolver</title>

<para>The XML Resolver is distributed in two ways: you can get it as a release
from <link xlink:href="https://github.com/xmlresolver/xmlresolver/releases">GitHub</link>,
or you can get it from Maven with coordinates like these:</para>

<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>org.xmlresolver</groupId>
  <artifactId>xmlresolver</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.xmlresolver</groupId>
  <artifactId>xmlresolver</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
  <classifier>data</classifier>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>

<para>Place the XML Resolver jar file on your classpath to use the resolver.
If you also place the “data” jar file on your classpath, you will automatically
get local resolution of a large number of open source schemas and DTDs. (These are
mostly from the W3C for the reasons described above.)</para>

<para>Other distributions can also take advantage of this automatic
behavior by placing a catalog file at
<literal>org/xmlresolver/catalog.xml</literal> in the jar file. For example, the
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/docbook">DocBook schemas</link>
and
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslTNG">xslTNG</link> releases do this.
Simply placing those jar files in your classpath will make catalog resolution of
the standard URIs quick and efficient.

<title>How to use XML Resolver</title>

<para>The simplest possible thing you can do is instantiate an instance of
<code>org.xmlresolver.Resolver</code> and use it as the resolver for your parser.
The <code>Resolver</code> class implements the following resolvers:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><code>org.xml.sax.EntityResolver</code> the SAX1 interface used to load XML entities
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><code>org.xml.sax.EntityResolver2</code> the SAX2 interface used to load XML entities
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><code>javax.xml.transform.URIResolver</code> used to load XSLT resources
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><code>org.w3c.dom.ls.LSResourceResolver</code> used by the DOM to load resources
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><code>org.xmlresolver.NamespaceResolver</code> an interface for loading namespace-based
resources based on <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDDL(RDDL)">RDDL</link>
that never really took off, but there you go.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><code>javax.xml.stream.XMLResolver</code> the StAX interface used to load XML entities.
(This interface is actually supported by the <code>org.xmlresolver.StAXResolver</code> class
because the StAX <code>XMLResolver</code> API and the SAX <code>EntityResolver</code> APIs are
incompatible.)
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Another simple integration point is to instantiate
<code>org.xmlresolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader</code> as your XML parser.</para>

<section xml:id="programming">
<title>Programming with the resolver</title>
<para>If you want to take more complete programmatic control of the resolver,
instantiate a resolver configuration:</para>

<programlisting language="java"
><![CDATA[XMLResolverConfiguration config
  = new XMLResolverConfiguration(propertyFiles, catalogs);]]></programlisting>

<para>Set the features as you wish:</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[config.setFeature(ResolverFeature.CACHE_UNDER_HOME, false);

if (validateCatalogs) {
    config.setFeature(ResolverFeature.CATALOG_LOADER_CLASS,
                      "org.xmlresolver.loaders.ValidatingXmlLoader");
}]]></programlisting>

<para>Then instantiate a resolver:</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[Resolver resolver = new Resolver(config);]]></programlisting>

<para>and use that resolver in your parsing and URI retrieval.</para>

<para>For additional APIs, consult the <link xlink:href="javadoc/index.html">JavaDoc</link>.</para>

</section>
<section xml:id="configuring">
<title>Configuring XML Resolver</title>

<para>The Resolver classes use either Java system properties or a standard
Java properties file to establish an initial environment.</para>

<para>The resolver searches for a property file by looking in the following places,
in this order:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The location identified by the <code>xmlresolver.properties</code> system property.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The location identified by the <code>XMLRESOLVER_PROPERTIES</code> environment variable.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A file named <code>xmlresolver.properties</code> on your classpath.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The following features may be configured with properties.</para>

<section>
<title>The initial list of catalog files</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.files</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>catalogs</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A semicolon-delimited list of catalog files. These are the catalog
files that are initially consulted for resolution. If no catalog files
are specified, by default the resolver will attempt to use a file
named <code>catalog.xml</code> in the current directory as a catalog.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>A list of additional catalog files</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.additions</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>catalog-additions</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A semicolon-delimited list of catalog files. This list is used in
addition to the initial list of catalog files.</para>

<para>If you attempt to use both a system property _and_ a property from a
property file to create the initial list of catalog files, you’ll only
get one or the other. (See prefer-property-file.)</para>

<para>This property provides a way to add to the current list of files. For
example, suppose you use a global properties file to initialize the resolver, but
for a particular application you want to search _additional_ catalogs.
You can specify them in the <code>xml.catalog.additions</code> system property and they’ll
be appended to the list instead of replacing the list entirely as setting
<code>xml.catalog.files</code> would.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Load catalogs from the classpath</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.classpathCatalogs</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>classpath-catalogs</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Load catalog files from the classpath. If this property is true, the
resolver will search for all of the files named
<code>org/xmlresolver/catalog.xml</code> on the classpath and add each of them to the end
of the catalog list.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Preference for public or system identifiers</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.prefer</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>prefer</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The initial prefer setting, either public or system.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Obey <code>oasis-xml-catalog</code> processing instruction</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.allowPI</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>allow-oasis-xml-catalog-pi</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>This setting allows you to toggle whether or not the resolver classes
obey the <code><?oasis-xml-catalog?></code> processing instruction.</para>

<para>If you never use the processing instruction, you can get a very tiny
performance improvement by disabling this feature. (If this feature is
enabled, the parser has to create a copy of the resolver configuration
for every parse.)</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Support relative catalog paths</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>relative-catalogs</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If <code>relative-catalogs</code> is true, relative filenames in the <code>catalogs</code>
property list will be made absolute relative to the current working
directory; otherwise they will be made
absolute with respect to the base URI of the properties file from
which they came.</para>

<para>This setting has no effect on catalogs loaded from the
<code>xml.catalogs.files</code> system property which are always made absolute
with respect to the current working directory.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Cache documents</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System properties <code>xml.catalog.cache</code>, <code>xml.catalog.cacheUnderHome</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>cache</code>, <code>cacheUnderHome</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The <code>cache</code> properties specify the directory in which the XML Resolver
should attempt to cache files that fail to resolve locally. If, instead,
one of the <code>cacheUnderHome</code> properties is set, the cache directory will
default to <code>$HOME/.xmlresolver/cache</code>.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Prefer property file values</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.preferPropertyFile</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>prefer-property-file</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Prefer properties from the properties file.
If a property file is loaded to configure the resolver and one of the properties in that
file is also specified as a system property, the system property takes precedence.
If you’d prefer to have the property file take precedence (as was the case in some
earlier versions), set the “prefer property file” property to true.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Use URI entries for system resolution</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.uriForSystem</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>uri-for-system</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Ignore the distinction between system identifiers and URIs.
The distinction between external identifiers (the public and system identifiers that
are used in DTDs) and general URIs (as might be used to load a RELAX NG Grammar or XML Schema,
for example), is not supported uniformly by the parser APIs.
The Xerces XML Schema implementation, for example, users the <code>resolveEntity</code> API to load
XML Schema imports.</para>

<para>Ordinarily, system identifier resolution interrogates the <code>system</code> and <code>public</code> entries (and their
related entries), but not the <code>uri</code> entries. If this property is true, the resolver will attempt
to resolve system identifiers with <code>uri</code> entries (_after_ attempting to resolve them with the
system and public entries.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Merge http: and https: URI schemes</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.mergeHttps</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>merge-https</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Treat http: and https: URIs as equivalent for the purpose of resolution. The web used to
be served over http: and many existing catalog files contain http: system identifiers.
Today, the web is largely served over https: and many documents contain https: system
identifiers. If this property is true, that distinction will be ignored during catalog lookup,
<code>http://example.com/sample.dtd</code> will match <code>https://example.com/sample.dtd</code>.</para>

<para>Note: this has *no effect* on the URIs returned by the resolver or retrieved over the web.
It only effects catalog lookup for system identifiers and URIs.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Mask jar URIs</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.maskJarUris</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>mask-jar-uris</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Don’t return jar: or classpath: URIs. Most entity resolver APIs are defined such that if
resolution succeeds, the base URI of the resource returned is the base URI of the actual,
local resource. This can greatly simplify things because subsequent relative URIs can be
resolved against the local resource directly.</para>

<para>However, the Java URI class does not treat jar: or classpath: URI schemes as hierarchical,
so any subsequent attempts to resolve relative URIs will fail. If this property is true,
the local resource will be returned but the URI will be left unchanged. That may require a
more complete catalog, but it will avoid a situation which is guaranteed to fail.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Catalog loader class</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.catalogLoaderClass</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>catalog-loader-class</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Specify the catalog loader class. The default catalog loader ignores
any errors encountered when loading catalogs. This is convenient for
production use, but can be frustrating because it may not be obvious
when resolution fails, especially if your internet connection is fast.
A typo in a catalog file can easily go unnoticed.</para>

<para>If the value <code>org.xmlresolver.loaders.ValidatingXmlLoader</code> is specified
for this property, catalog files will be validated when they are
loaded and the resolver will throw an exception for any validity
errors encountered.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Parse RDDL documents</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>System property <code>xml.catalog.parseRddl</code></simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Property file property <code>parse-rddl</code></simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Attempt to resolve RDDL resources in namespace URI lookup. If the
namespace resolver is used, if a nature and purpose are specified, and
if the resource returned is an HTML document, the resolver will
attempt to find the RDDL resource description for the requested
namespace and resolve that URI.</para>

<para>For example, the following API call will return the XML Schema for XML:</para>

<programlisting language="java">resolveNamespaceURI("http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace",
                    "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema",
                    "http://www.rddl.org/purposes#schema-validation");</programlisting>

<para>Attempting to resolve RDDL resources requires extra processing. If you
know it will never succeed you can disable it by setting this property
to false.</para>

</section>
